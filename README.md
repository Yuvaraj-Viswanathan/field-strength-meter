## 🎯 Objective

To design and demonstrate a portable **Field Strength Meter** using discrete transistors for detecting and measuring the strength of electromagnetic fields in the RF range.

---

## 🧪 Working Principle

- Transistors act as **amplifiers and detectors** to capture RF signals.
- Signals are rectified and filtered to extract envelope data.
- The output is displayed via a **meter or digital interface** to represent RF field strength.

---

## ⚙️ Features

- ✅ **Low-cost** and easy-to-build circuit
- 📦 **Portable** for field measurements
- 📊 **Analog or digital output**
- 🧰 Transistor-based — no microcontroller needed
- 💡 Useful for HAM, RF labs, and telecom
